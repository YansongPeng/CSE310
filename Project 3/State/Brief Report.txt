1. Describe any problems encountered in your implementation for this project milestone.
• I had a hard time using the breadth-first search algorithm for the components operation, so I opted for the depth-first search algorithm.
• I mistakenly implemented my milestone with a List, but was told this is unnacceptable. Switching to an array can add a lot of extra work and bugs to my tested milestone submission.

2. Describe any known bugs and/or incomplete command implementation for the project milestone.
• No known bugs / incomplete commands exist in this project milestone submission. Everything has been tested for correctness.
• Shortest Path and Diameter must still be implemented before my complete project submission.

3. Describe any significant collaboration with anyone (peers or otherwise) and/or clearly reference any external code bases used.
