1.Describe any problems encountered in your implementation for this project milestone.
	• My implementation and logic flow is sloppy. If I had more time, I would definitely better migrate my repeated code to functions. This includes my elapsed time (timer) statistical data and function output (Avg num of steps: / Time to run:).





2. Describe any known bugs and/or incomplete command implementation for the project milestone.
	• All of my implementation is complete, working and tested.




3. Describe any significant collaboration with anyone (peers or otherwise) and/or clearly reference any external code bases used.
	• StackOverflow is a huge relief for small compiler issues.
	•	I used a derivative of this users timeoftheday() implementation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5362577/c-gettimeofday-for-computing-time
