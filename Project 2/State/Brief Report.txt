1. Describe any problems encountered in your implementation for this project milestone.
This project proved especially difficult because of the wide usage of pointers. Once issues were solved for pointers, the project implementation was smoother, but still hard.

There were a lot of complex algorithms and data structures to maintain, which proved to be difficult.

Because of some major personal events, time was very limited to work on this project.

I forgot to use getline instead of cin for app_name and category_name. This caused a lot of errors and restructuring when I realized that some app names/category names are multiple words, space seperated.

2. Describe any known bugs and/or incomplete command implementation for the project milestone.
Again, forgetting to use getline instead of cin for app_name and category_name was my biggest issue. The whole app broke when a test was ran with multiword apps/categories.

I was having trouble accessing general.asu, but I did manage to briefly test my code on general.asu.edu. Hopefully there are no further issues that show up on general.asu.edu but not OS X 10.11 g++.

3. Describe any significant collaboration with anyone (peers or otherwise) and/or clearly reference any external code bases used.
